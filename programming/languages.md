# Some notable languages that were developed in this period include:

- **1951 – Regional Assembly Language.**
- 1952 – Autocode.
- 1954 – IPL (forerunner to LISP)
- 1955 – FLOW-MATIC (led to COBOL)
- **1957 – FORTRAN (First compiler)**
- 1957 – COMTRAN (precursor to COBOL)
- **1958 – LISP.**
- **1958 – ALGOL 58.**
- **1959 – COBOL**           
- 1959 – RPG
- 1962 – APL
- **1962 – Simula**
  invented in the late 1960s by Nygaard and Dahl as a superset of Algol 60, was the first language designed to support object-oriented programming.
- 1962 – SNOBOL
- 1963 – CPL (forerunner to C)
- 1964 – Speakeasy (computational environment)
- 1964 – BASIC
- 1964 – PL/I
- 1966 – JOSS
- 1967 – BCPL (forerunner to C)

# [Polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)#Row_polymorphism)

- [Ad hoc polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc_polymorphism) - is a kind of polymorphism in which polymorphic functions can be applied to arguments of different types, because a polymorphic function can denote a number of distinct and potentially heterogeneous implementations depending on the type of argument(s) to which it is applied. 

-	Parametric polymorphism
- Subtyping
- ...

### Static and dynamic polymorphism

Polymorphism can be distinguished by when the implementation is selected: statically (at compile time) or dynamically (at run time, typically via a virtual function). This is known respectively as static dispatch and dynamic dispatch, and the corresponding forms of polymorphism are accordingly called static polymorphism and dynamic polymorphism.

ML is clean and powerful, and has many traits that language designers consider hallmarks of a good high-level language
