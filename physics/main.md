# Physics

- [Matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter) <br/>
is any substance that has mass and takes up space by having volume
- [Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force) <br/>
is an influence that can change the motion of an object
- [Carrier Particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_carrier) <br/>
also known as messenger particle or intermediate particle, is a type of particle that gives rise to forces between other particles

# Composite Particles
are subatomic particles that are made of more than one quark. Simple particles like protons are actually composites of multiple quarks. Protons are known as baryons, which means that they are made of exactly three quarks

- [Hadrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadron) <br/>
is a composite subatomic particle made of two or more quarks held together by the strong interaction
- Atom
- Molecule
- Compunds

## [Atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom)
is composed of a nucleus and one or more electrons bound to the nucleus. The nucleus is made of one or more protons and a number of neutrons
