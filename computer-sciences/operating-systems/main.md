# Command-line

- **Terminal** <br/>
A terminal is a text input and output environment
- **Console** <br/>
A console is a physical terminal
- **Shell** <br/>
is an interface between the user and the operating system
- **sh** <br/>
implements the shell interface, that actually processes commands and outputs results
- **bash** <br/>
is a superset of sh
