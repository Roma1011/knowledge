# Features

- [AlwaysOn](https://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertip/4717/what-is-sql-server-alwayson/) <br/>
is a marketing term which refers to the high availability and disaster recovery solution introduced when SQL Server 2012 was launched
  - [Failover Cluster Instances (FCI)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/failover-clusters/windows/always-on-failover-cluster-instances-sql-server):<br/> 
is a traditional failover clustering solution where all nodes in the cluster have access to the shared storage. In case of a failure, the SQL Server instance fails over to another node in the cluster
  - [Availability Group (AG)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/availability-groups/windows/overview-of-always-on-availability-groups-sql-server): <br/>
 is a more advanced HA solution that provides high availability and disaster recovery. It allows you to create a group of databases that can fail over together to another replica (instance)
  - [Contained Availability Group](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/availability-groups/windows/contained-availability-groups-overview) <br/>
  you can create an availability group without having to create an external cluster or Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) environment
  - [Basic Availability Group (BAG)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/availability-groups/windows/basic-availability-groups-always-on-availability-groups?view=sql-server-ver16): <br/>
   replaces the deprecated Database Mirroring feature and provides a similar level of feature support
  - [Distributed Availability Group (DAG)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/availability-groups/windows/distributed-availability-groups): <br/>
  A distributed availability group is a special type of availability group that spans two separate availability groups. The availability groups that participate in a distributed availability group don't need to be in the same location. They can be physical, virtual, on-premises, in the public cloud, or anywhere that supports an availability group deployment
  - [Read-Scale Availability Groups without Cluster](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/availability-groups/windows/read-scale-availability-groups?view=sql-server-ver16#read-scale-availability-groups-without-cluster) <br/>
  secondary replicas were configured for read operations. If high availability wasn't the goal, considerable operational overhead was expended to configure and operate a cluster. SQL Server 2017 introduces read-scale availability groups without a cluster
- Database Mirroring (Depricated)

- Log Shipping

# [Data Quality Servicves](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/data-quality-services/data-quality-services?view=sql-server-2017)
DQS is not an absolute. Provides an assessment of potentially incorrect data based upon semantic model
- Components
 - **Data Cleansing:** Modification, removal or enrichment of data that is incorect or incomplete
 - **Matching:** Identification of semantic duplicates in a rules-vased process
 - **Reference Data Sevices:** Verification of the quality of data using the services of a reference data provider
 - **Profiling:** Analysis of a data source to provide insight inot the qiuality of the data at every stage in the knowledge discovery, domain managment, matching, and data cleansing processes
 - **Monitoring:** Tracking and determination of the state of data quality activities
 - **Knowledge Base:** Data Quality Sevices is a knowledge-driven solution that analyzes data based upon knowledge that you build with DQS
