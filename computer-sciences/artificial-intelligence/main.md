**Machine learning** and **deep learning** are both subfields of artificial intelligence (AI) that involve training algorithms to recognize patterns in data. However, they differ in their approach, architecture, and application.

- **Machine learning** <br/> 
is a method of training algorithms to learn patterns in data, without being explicitly programmed. It involves using statistical models to identify patterns and make predictions based on past data. Machine learning algorithms can be divided into supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

- **Deep learning** <br/>
on the other hand, is a subfield of machine learning that involves training artificial neural networks to recognize patterns in data. It uses deep neural networks, which are composed of multiple layers of interconnected nodes that perform complex computations on data. Deep learning algorithms are particularly effective for tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous driving.

In summary, while both machine learning and deep learning involve training algorithms to recognize patterns in data, deep learning involves using more complex neural networks with multiple layers, making it more suitable for complex tasks that require high accuracy and precision.
