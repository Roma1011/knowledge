# [Polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)#Row_polymorphism)

- [Ad hoc polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc_polymorphism) - is a kind of polymorphism in which polymorphic functions can be applied to arguments of different types, because a polymorphic function can denote a number of distinct and potentially heterogeneous implementations depending on the type of argument(s) to which it is applied. 

-	[Parametric polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_polymorphism) - allows a function or a data type to be written generically, so that it can handle values uniformly without depending on their type

- [Subtyping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtyping) - allows a function to be written to take an object of a certain type **T**, but also work correctly, if passed an object that belongs to a type **S** that is a subtype of **T** (according to the Liskov substitution principle).

### Static and dynamic polymorphism

Polymorphism can be distinguished by when the implementation is selected: statically (at compile time) or dynamically (at run time, typically via a virtual function). This is known respectively as **static dispatch** and **dynamic dispatch**, and the corresponding forms of polymorphism are accordingly called **static polymorphism** and **dynamic polymorphism**.

# [Encapsulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)) 

In programming languages, encapsulation is used to refer to one of two related but distinct notions, and sometimes to the combination thereof:
- A language mechanism for restricting direct access to some of the object's components.
- A language construct that facilitates the bundling of data with the methods (or other functions) operating on that data.
