# [Polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(computer_science)#Row_polymorphism)

- [Ad hoc polymorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc_polymorphism) - is a kind of polymorphism in which polymorphic functions can be applied to arguments of different types, because a polymorphic function can denote a number of distinct and potentially heterogeneous implementations depending on the type of argument(s) to which it is applied.

### Static and dynamic polymorphism

Polymorphism can be distinguished by when the implementation is selected: statically (at compile time) or dynamically (at run time, typically via a virtual function). This is known respectively as static dispatch and dynamic dispatch, and the corresponding forms of polymorphism are accordingly called static polymorphism and dynamic polymorphism.
