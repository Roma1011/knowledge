## Types of machine learning models

Machine learning can be broadly classified into three types:

- Predictive 
  - Supervised <br>
  the algorithm is trained on labeled data, which means that the input data has an associated output label. The goal of the algorithm is to learn a mapping between the input data and the output label. Some common supervised learning tasks include classification and regression

- Descriptive 
  - Unsupervised <br/>
  In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is trained on unlabeled data, which means that the input data has no associated output label. The goal of the algorithm is to find patterns or structure in the input data. Some common unsupervised learning tasks include clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection

- Reinforcment <br/>
In reinforcement learning, the algorithm learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. The goal of the algorithm is to learn a policy that maximizes the cumulative reward over time. Reinforcement learning is commonly used in applications such as robotics, game playing, and autonomous vehicles

There are also several subcategories within these three main types of machine learning, such as semi-supervised learning, active learning, and deep learning. The choice of machine learning type depends on the nature of the data and the specific task at hand
