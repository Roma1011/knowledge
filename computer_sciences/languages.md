# [Histrory of Languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_programming_languages)
Some notable languages that were developed in this period include:
- [Comparison of programming languages](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A1%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D1%8F%D0%B7%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2_%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F)

### First programming languages
In the 1940s, the first recognizably modern electrically powered computers were created. The limited speed and memory capacity forced programmers to write hand tuned assembly language programs. It was eventually realized that programming in assembly language required a great deal of intellectual effort.

  - **1951 – Regional Assembly Language.**
  - 1952 – Autocode.
  - 1954 – IPL (forerunner to LISP)
  - 1955 – FLOW-MATIC (led to COBOL)
  - **1957 – FORTRAN (First compiler)**
  - 1957 – COMTRAN (precursor to COBOL)
  - **1958 – LISP.**
  - **1958 – ALGOL 58.**
  - **1959 – COBOL**           
  - 1959 – RPG
  - 1962 – APL
  - **1962 – Simula**
    invented in the late 1960s by Nygaard and Dahl as a superset of Algol 60, was the first language designed to support object-oriented programming.
  - 1962 – SNOBOL
  - 1963 – CPL (forerunner to C)
  - 1964 – Speakeasy (computational environment)
  - 1964 – BASIC
  - 1964 – PL/I
  - 1966 – JOSS
  - 1967 – BCPL (forerunner to C)
  
### Establishing fundamental paradigms  
The period from the late 1960s to the late 1970s brought a major flowering of programming languages. Most of the major language paradigms now in use were invented in this period:

- 1968 – Logo
- 1969 – B (forerunner to C)
- **1970 – Pascal**
- 1970 – Forth
- **1972 – C**
- **1972 – Smalltalk**
- **1972 – Prolog**
- **1973 – ML**
- **1975 – Scheme**
- **1978 – SQL** (a query language, later extended)

### 1980s: consolidation, modules, performance
- **1980 – C++** (as C with classes, renamed in 1983)
- 1983 – Ada
- **1984 – Common Lisp**
- 1984 – MATLAB
- 1984 - dBase III, dBase III Plus
- 1985 – Eiffel
- **1986 – Objective-C**         
- 1986 – LabVIEW (Visual Programming Language)
- **1986 – Erlang**
- 1987 – Perl
- 1988 – Tcl
- 1988 – Wolfram Language (as part of Mathematica, only got a separate name in June 2013)
- 1989 – FL (Backus)   

### 1990s: the Internet age
- **1990 – Haskell**
- **1991 – Python**
- **1991 – Visual Basic**
- 1993 – Lua
- **1993 – R**
- 1994 – CLOS (part of ANSI Common Lisp)
- **1995 – Ruby**
- 1995 – Ada 95                                                    
- **1995 – Java**
- **1995 – Delphi (Object Pascal)**
- **1995 – JavaScript**
- **1995 – PHP**
- 1997 – Rebol

### Current trends
Programming language evolution continues, in both industry and research. Some of the recent trends have included:

- **2000 – ActionScript**
- **2001 – C#**
- 2001 – D
- 2002 – Scratch
- **2003 – Groovy**
- **2003 – Scala**
- **2005 – F#**
- **2006 – PowerShell**
- **2007 – Clojure**
- **2009 – Go**
- **2010 – Rust**
- **2011 – Dart**
- **2011 – Kotlin**
- 2011 – Red
- **2011 - Elixir**
- 2012 – Julia
- **2014 – Swift**
- 2016 – Ring


# [Programming Paradigms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm)

A programming paradigm is a complex of concepts, principles and abstractions which define a fundamental style of programming.
Note that it is not necessary for a language to use one and only one paradigm. Languages which are designed to support several paradigms are called multi-paradigm.

- Array
- Concatenative
- Concurrent
- **[Declarative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming)**
- Esoteric
- Function-level
- **[Functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)**
- **Generic**
- **[Imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming)**
- [Logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming)
- **Message passing**
- Metaprogramming
- Non-strict
- **[Object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)**
- **[Procedural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming)**
- Prototype-based
- **Reflective**
- Scalar
- Stack-oriented
- Strict
- **[Structured](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming)**
- Tabular
- Tacit
- Value-level
- Visual

# [Type theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory)

Two well-known type theories, that can serve as mathematical foundations are:
- [Typed λ-calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typed_lambda_calculus) - Alonzo Church  
- [Intuitionistic Type Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionistic_type_theory) - Per Martin-Löf

# [Dependent type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type)
In computer science and logic, a **dependent type** is a type whose definition depends on a value. 

# [History of ML](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse341/04wi/lectures/02-ml-intro.html)
ML is clean and powerful, and has many traits that language designers consider hallmarks of a good high-level language
